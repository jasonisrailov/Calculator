# Calculator
I recently came across my old iPhone 4s while doing some spring cleaning. This was my old iPhone from 2013 that I thought was the fastest smartphone ever. 

I was thinking of new projects I could work on. I took a look at the calculator app from iOS 9.3.6 thought it would be a great project as it is neigther easy or extremly challenging. 

This repo holds the calculator project I created to strengthen my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

TL;DR: This calculator app was inspired by the iOS 9.3.6 calculator app from my iPhone 4s that I found while doing some spring cleaning.
